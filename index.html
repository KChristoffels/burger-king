                The ingredients are fresh and recognisable. Did you know that an other fastfood restaurant with that
                pathetic clown
                claims to serve something that doesn't even come close to a vegan product. Asuming I was eating one at

            <h2>Proof McDonals just wants to see you burn in hell</h2>
            <p> The "McDonald's coffee case", Liebeck v. McDonald's is a well-known
                product liability lawsuit that became a flash point in the debate in
                the U.S. over tort reform after a jury awarded $2.9 million to Stella
                Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who sued
                McDonald's after she suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee that
                was spilled on her at one of the company's drive-thrus in 1992. The
                trial judge reduced the total award to $640,000, and the parties
                settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided. The
                case entered popular understanding as an example of frivolous
                litigation; ABC News calls the case "the poster child of excessive
                lawsuits." Trial-lawyer groups such as the Association of Trial
                Lawyers of America and other opponents of tort reform sometimes argue
                that the suit was justified because of the extent of Liebeck's
                injuries, as the coffee in question was at a temperature too hot for
                human consumption which McDonald's failed to provide proper warning.
                Warning consumers of possible dangers of their products is strictly
                enforced by the FDA. Furthermore, McDonald's should not be serving
                substances that are potentially harmful to their consumers.</p>
